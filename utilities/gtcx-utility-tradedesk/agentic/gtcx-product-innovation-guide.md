## 4. Feature Prioritization

### 4.1 Prioritization Framework

**RICE Scoring Model:**
```
Score = (Reach × Impact × Confidence) / Effort

Reach: Number of users affected per quarter
Impact: Massive (3), High (2), Medium (1), Low (0.5)
Confidence: High (100%), Medium (80%), Low (50%)
Effort: Person-months required
```

**Example Prioritization:**
```
Feature: Offline Payment Verification
Reach: 5,000 users
Impact: 3 (Massive - enables rural transactions)
Confidence: 80%
Effort: 2 person-months
RICE Score: (5000 × 3 × 0.8) / 2 = 6,000

Feature: Advanced Analytics Dashboard
Reach: 50 users
Impact: 2 (High - improves government oversight)
Confidence: 100%
Effort: 3 person-months
RICE Score: (50 × 2 × 1) / 3 = 33
```
