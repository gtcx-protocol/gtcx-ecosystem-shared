## üîß **Technical Architecture**

### **Crypto Proof Generation:**
```typescript
// GPS Location Signing
const locationData = {
  latitude: currentLocation.latitude,
  longitude: currentLocation.longitude,
  accuracy: currentLocation.accuracy,
  timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
  role: currentRole.id,
  userId: 'demo@gtcx.com',
};

const signature = await CryptoService.signLocationData(locationData);
const proof = {
  data: locationData,
  signature,
  publicKey: await CryptoService.getPublicKey(),
  certificateHash: await CryptoService.generateLocationCertificate(locationData),
};
```

### **Photo Evidence Verification:**
```typescript
// Camera Photo Signing
const photoData = {
  id: photo.id,
  timestamp: photo.timestamp,
  location: photo.location,
  role: currentRole.id,
  userId: 'demo@gtcx.com',
  filename: photo.filename,
};

photo.cryptoProof = {
  signature: await CryptoService.signPhotoData(photoData),
  publicKey: await CryptoService.getPublicKey(),
  certificateHash: await CryptoService.generatePhotoCertificate(photoData),
  isVerified: true,
};
```

### **Integration Points:**
- **Role-Based**: Crypto features only activate when user has selected mining industry role
- **Backwards Compatible**: All existing functionality preserved
- **Error Handling**: Graceful fallback when crypto operations fail
- **Performance**: Crypto operations run asynchronously without blocking UI

## üîí **Security Implementation**

### **Cryptographic Standards:**
- **Ed25519**: Industry-standard elliptic curve signatures
- **SHA-256**: Secure hashing for data integrity
- **Noble Crypto**: Audited crypto library implementation
- **Secure Key Storage**: Private keys stored in device secure storage

### **Verification Chain:**
1. **Data Integrity**: SHA-256 hashes prevent tampering
2. **Digital Signatures**: Ed25519 signatures prove authenticity
3. **Public Key Verification**: Anyone can verify signatures using public key
4. **Certificate Generation**: Tamper-proof certificates for official use

### **Mining Industry Compliance:**
- **Government Ready**: Cryptographic proofs suitable for regulatory compliance
- **Tamper Detection**: Any data modification invalidates the signature
- **Audit Trail**: Complete chain of custody for location and photo evidence
- **Export Capable**: Crypto proofs can be exported for official documentation
