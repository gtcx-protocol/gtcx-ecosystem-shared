## ‚úÖ **COMMITMENT TO ACCURACY**

These estimates are based on:
- ‚úÖ Realistic development time including debugging
- ‚úÖ Integration complexity analysis
- ‚úÖ Testing and deployment time
- ‚úÖ Unknown unknown buffer (30% added to all estimates)
- ‚úÖ Dependencies and blocking factors
- ‚úÖ Current skill level and velocity

**NO MORE OPTIMISTIC ESTIMATES. NO MORE "ALMOST READY" CLAIMS.**

This timeline is conservative and realistic. Meeting these targets requires dedicated focus and resources.
