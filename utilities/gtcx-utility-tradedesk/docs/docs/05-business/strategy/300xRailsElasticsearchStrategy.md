# 🚀 300X RAILS + ELASTICSEARCH IMPLEMENTATION STRATEGY
*World-Class Backend Architecture for Global Commodity Trading*

## 🎯 **MISSION: DEPLOY ENTERPRISE-GRADE BACKEND IN 72 HOURS**

### ⚡ **PRIORITY 1: RAILS API PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT**

#### 📊 **Current Status Assessment**
```bash
✅ Rails Backend: 95% Complete (full auth, models, controllers)
✅ Database Schema: Ready (users, locations, payments, mining_operations)
✅ Authentication: JWT + bcrypt + biometric support
✅ API Endpoints: RESTful architecture with proper serialization
⚠️ Deployment: Need to replace Sinatra with Rails (port 3002)
```

#### 🏗️ **Rails Production Architecture**
```ruby
# Production Stack:
Rails 7.0.8 API-only mode
PostgreSQL 15 with connection pooling
Redis 7 for sessions and background jobs
Sidekiq for async payment processing  
Puma web server (multi-threaded)
ActionCable for real-time trading updates
Rack::Attack for rate limiting
JWT authentication with refresh tokens
```

### ⚡ **PRIORITY 2: ELASTICSEARCH INTEGRATION**

#### 🔍 **Search Architecture Design**
```yaml
Elasticsearch 8.x Cluster:
  - Single node initially (AWS OpenSearch)
  - Indexes: users, locations, transactions, gold_lots
  - Real-time indexing via Rails callbacks
  - Advanced search with geospatial queries
  - Analytics and aggregations for business intelligence

## 🧪 **COMPREHENSIVE TESTING SUITE**

### 🔬 **Unit Testing Framework**

#### **Backend Testing (RSpec)**
```ruby
# Test Coverage Requirements:
- Models: 100% coverage (validations, relationships, methods)
- Controllers: 95% coverage (authentication, authorization, responses)
- Services: 100% coverage (business logic, external integrations)
- Jobs: 95% coverage (background processing, error handling)
- Serializers: 90% coverage (data formatting, performance)

# Example Test Structure:
describe User do
  describe 'authentication' do
    it 'generates JWT token on successful login'
    it 'refreshes token before expiry'
    it 'locks account after failed attempts'
    it 'validates biometric enrollment'
  end
  
  describe 'permissions' do
    it 'restricts miner access to mining operations'
    it 'allows traders to create gold lots'
    it 'grants government officials compliance access'
  end
end
```

#### **Frontend Testing (Jest + Cypress)**
```javascript
// Unit Tests (Jest)
describe('Authentication Service', () => {
  test('login with valid credentials', async () => {
    const response = await authService.login(validCredentials);
    expect(response.token).toBeDefined();
    expect(response.user.role).toBe('trader');
  });
  
  test('handles authentication errors', async () => {
    await expect(authService.login(invalidCredentials))
      .rejects.toThrow('Invalid credentials');
  });
});

// Integration Tests (Cypress)
describe('User Registration Flow', () => {
  it('completes trader registration', () => {
    cy.visit('/auth');
    cy.get('[data-cy="register-tab"]').click();
    cy.get('[data-cy="email-input"]').type('trader@example.com');
    cy.get('[data-cy="password-input"]').type('SecurePass123');
    cy.get('[data-cy="role-trader"]').click();
    cy.get('[data-cy="register-button"]').click();
    cy.url().should('include', '/dashboard');
  });
});
```

### 🚀 **Performance Testing Suite**

#### **Load Testing (K6)**
```javascript
// API Performance Tests
import http from 'k6/http';
import { check, sleep } from 'k6';

export let options = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '2m', target: 100 }, // Ramp up
    { duration: '5m', target: 500 }, // Peak load
    { duration: '2m', target: 0 },   // Cool down
  ],
};

export default function() {
  // Test authentication endpoint
  let response = http.post('https://api.gtcx.africa/api/v1/auth/login', {
    email: 'test@example.com',
    password: 'password123'
  });
  
  check(response, {
    'status is 200': (r) => r.status === 200,
    'response time < 500ms': (r) => r.timings.duration < 500,
    'token received': (r) => r.json('token') !== null,
  });
  
  sleep(1);
}
```

## 📊 **USER ACCEPTANCE TESTING (UAT) FRAMEWORK**

### 👥 **UAT Test Scenarios**

#### **Miner Onboarding UAT**
```gherkin
Feature: Miner Registration and Verification
  As a gold miner in Ghana
  I want to register on the GTCX platform
  So that I can sell my gold through verified channels

Background:
  Given I am a licensed gold miner
  And I have my mining permit number
  And I have a valid Ghana ID card

Scenario: Successful Miner Registration
  Given I visit the TradePass registration page
  When I select "Miner" as my role
  And I enter my personal information
  And I enter my mining permit number "GH-MINE-2025-001"
  And I upload my ID document
  And I complete biometric enrollment
  Then I should receive email verification
  And my account should be pending approval
  And I should be redirected to the verification waiting page

Scenario: Mining Permit Verification
  Given I am a registered miner with pending status
  When the admin verifies my permit with Ghana Minerals Commission
  Then my account status should change to "active"
  And I should receive notification of approval
  And I should be able to access full miner features
```

#### **Trading Flow UAT**
```gherkin
Feature: Gold Lot Trading
  As an active trader
  I want to buy and sell gold lots
  So that I can conduct commodity trading

Scenario: Create Gold Lot Listing
  Given I am logged in as a verified miner
  And I have gold to sell
  When I navigate to "Create Gold Lot"
  And I enter lot details:
    | Field    | Value           |
    | Weight   | 100 grams      |
    | Purity   | 18 karat       |
    | Location | Ashanti Region |
    | Price    | $5,500         |
  And I upload photos of the gold
  And I confirm GPS location
  Then the lot should be created
  And it should appear in the marketplace
  And I should receive confirmation

Scenario: Purchase Gold Lot
  Given I am logged in as a verified trader
  And there are gold lots available
  When I search for lots in "Greater Accra"
  And I select a lot worth $5,500
  And I initiate purchase
  And I complete payment via MTN Mobile Money
  Then the payment should be processed
  And the lot ownership should transfer
  And both parties should receive notifications
```
