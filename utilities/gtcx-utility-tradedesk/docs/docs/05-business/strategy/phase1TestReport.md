## 🔧 **Technical Architecture**

### **Role-Based Routing System:**
```typescript
// Intelligent feature selection based on user role
const getRoleFeatures = () => {
  switch (currentRole.id) {
    case 'small-scale-miner':
      return minerWorkflows;    // Gold discovery focus
    case 'government-inspector':
      return inspectorTools;    // Compliance focus
    case 'mining-company':
      return companyDashboard;  // Operations focus
    case 'gold-trader':
      return traderVerification; // Origin verification focus
  }
};
```

### **Crypto Service Integration:**
- ✅ Noble crypto libraries installed
- ✅ Ed25519 signature system ready
- ✅ Service copied to `/src/services/crypto.ts`
- ✅ Ready for GPS/camera enhancement
