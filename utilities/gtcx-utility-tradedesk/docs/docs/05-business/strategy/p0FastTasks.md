## 🎯 **TOTAL EXPECTED TIME: 84 MINUTES (1.4 HOURS)**

**That's right - we should be able to get a working user registration system in under 2 hours once we fix the AWS connectivity.**

---

## 🚨 **CRITICAL PATH ANALYSIS**

### **THE ONE REAL BLOCKER:**
```bash
❌ SSH ACCESS TO SERVER
└── Blocks: Everything else
    ├── Can't deploy API code
    ├── Can't set up database  
    ├── Can't test endpoints
    └── Can't configure services
```

### **ONCE SSH WORKS, EVERYTHING ELSE IS FAST:**
```bash
✅ SSH Working
├── 15 min → Enhanced API deployed and running
├── 10 min → SQLite database with user tables
├── 20 min → Registration/login endpoints working
├── 15 min → Mobile app connecting to API
└── 60 min → Complete user workflow functioning
```

## 📋 **IMMEDIATE P0 ACTION LIST**

### **RIGHT NOW (Next 30 minutes):**

1. **🔍 AWS Console Check** (5 min)
   - [ ] Login to AWS Console
   - [ ] Check EC2 instance status (running/stopped?)
   - [ ] Note instance ID and current IP
   - [ ] Check Security Groups

2. **🚀 Fix Instance** (10 min)
   - [ ] Start instance if stopped
   - [ ] Verify Security Group has ports 22, 80, 3001, 3002 open
   - [ ] Download SSH key if needed
   - [ ] Test SSH connection

3. **📦 Deploy Enhanced API** (15 min)
   - [ ] `scp gtcx-rails-api.rb ubuntu@server:/opt/`
   - [ ] `ssh ubuntu@server "gem install sinatra sqlite3 bcrypt jwt"`
   - [ ] `ssh ubuntu@server "cd /opt && ruby gtcx-rails-api.rb"`
   - [ ] Test: `curl http://server:3002/health`

### **AFTER SSH WORKS (Next 30 minutes):**

4. **👤 Test User Registration** (10 min)
   - [ ] `curl -X POST http://server:3002/api/v1/auth/register -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"test123","firstName":"Test","lastName":"User","role":"miner"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'`
   - [ ] `curl -X POST http://server:3002/api/v1/auth/login -d '{"email":"test@test.com","password":"test123"}' -H 'Content-Type: application/json'`

5. **📱 Connect Mobile App** (10 min)
   - [ ] Update API_URL in app config to server URL
   - [ ] Test registration screen in Expo
   - [ ] Verify login works from mobile

6. **✅ Verify End-to-End** (10 min)
   - [ ] Register new user via mobile app
   - [ ] Login with credentials
   - [ ] Check data persisted in database

## 💡 **WHY THESE SHOULD BE FAST:**

### **✅ CODE ALREADY EXISTS:**
- Enhanced API with all endpoints: ✅ Written
- User authentication with JWT: ✅ Written  
- Database schema and models: ✅ Written
- React Native app with forms: ✅ Written
- Deployment scripts: ✅ Written

### **✅ INFRASTRUCTURE IS STANDARD:**
- AWS EC2 Ubuntu server: ✅ Standard setup
- SQLite database: ✅ No server configuration needed
- Ruby/Sinatra: ✅ Simple deployment
- Domain DNS: ✅ Already configured

### **✅ NO COMPLEX INTEGRATIONS:**
- No third-party APIs required for basic auth
- No payment processing for user registration
- No government APIs for basic functionality
- No complex search for basic user management

## 🎯 **SUCCESS CRITERIA (Today):**

**By End of Day:**
- [ ] SSH access to server working
- [ ] Enhanced API responding to health checks
- [ ] User can register via API endpoint
- [ ] User can login and get JWT token
- [ ] Mobile app can connect to production API

**Tomorrow:**
- [ ] Basic gold lot creation working
- [ ] Trader can browse gold lots
- [ ] End-to-end user workflow demo ready

## 🚀 **THE REALITY:**

**We have 95% of the work already done. We just need 1-2 hours of basic DevOps to get it live.**

**What's your AWS console showing for the EC2 instance status?**
