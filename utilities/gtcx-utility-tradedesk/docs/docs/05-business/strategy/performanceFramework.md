- **Alert Check Frequency**: 10 seconds
- **Data Retention**: 20 reports, 100 alerts
- **Auto-Optimization**: Disabled by default (configurable)

## Usage

### Basic Setup
```typescript
import { performanceMonitor } from '@/services/performance-monitor';

// Start monitoring
performanceMonitor.startMonitoring();

// Configure thresholds
await performanceMonitor.updateConfiguration({
  autoOptimization: true,
  reportingInterval: 3, // 3 minutes
});
```

### Getting Performance Data
```typescript
// Current health status
const isHealthy = performanceMonitor.isActive();

// Generate report
const report = await performanceMonitor.generatePerformanceReport();
console.log(`Health Score: ${report.healthScore}/100`);

// Get active alerts
const alerts = await performanceMonitor.getAlerts();
alerts.forEach(alert => {
  console.log(`‚ö†Ô∏è ${alert.message}`);
  console.log(`üí° ${alert.recommendation}`);
});

// Export diagnostics
const diagnostics = await performanceMonitor.exportDiagnostics();
```
