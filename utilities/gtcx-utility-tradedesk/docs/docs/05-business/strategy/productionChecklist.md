- [ ] TradePass app integration testing
- [ ] User profile endpoint enhancement

## ðŸ“‹ **REQUIRED FOR MVP LAUNCH**

### **Week 1 Priorities**
- [ ] **Persistent Database** (Currently in-memory)
  - [ ] SQLite with file persistence
  - [ ] User data backup strategy
  - [ ] Database migrations setup

- [ ] **GPS Location Verification** (Core feature)
  - [ ] Location capture endpoint
  - [ ] Cryptographic proof generation
  - [ ] Location history storage
  - [ ] Offline sync capability

- [ ] **Basic Gold Lot Management**
  - [ ] Create lot endpoint
  - [ ] Photo upload capability
  - [ ] List lots endpoint
  - [ ] Basic search/filter

### **Week 2 Priorities**
- [ ] **Security Hardening**
  - [ ] HTTPS certificate (Let's Encrypt)
  - [ ] Rate limiting
  - [ ] Input validation
  - [ ] SQL injection prevention

- [ ] **Production Infrastructure**
  - [ ] Domain name setup (api.gtcx.com)
  - [ ] Load balancer configuration
  - [ ] Automated backups
  - [ ] Monitoring & alerts

- [ ] **Ghana Government Integration**
  - [ ] API credentials from Minerals Commission
  - [ ] Compliance endpoints
  - [ ] Permit verification

## ðŸŽ¯ **SUCCESS METRICS**
- API uptime: 99.9% target
- Response time: <200ms average
- User registrations: 100+ in first week
- Active users: 50+ daily
- Zero security incidents

## ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL BLOCKERS**
1. Database persistence (users lost on restart)
2. No HTTPS (security risk)
3. No monitoring (blind to issues)
4. No backup strategy (data loss risk)

## ðŸ“Š **LAUNCH READINESS: 65%**
- Authentication: âœ… 100%
- Infrastructure: âœ… 80%
- Core Features: ðŸ”„ 40%
- Security: ðŸ”„ 50%
- Documentation: âœ… 100%

## ðŸŽ¯ **Next 3 Actions**
1. Add SQLite persistence to API server
2. Implement GPS location endpoint
3. Deploy HTTPS with domain name
