## 🏗️ Core Architectural Principles

### 1. Clean Architecture Foundation
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                UI Layer                 │  ← React Native Components
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│            Presentation Layer           │  ← ViewModels, UI State
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│            Application Layer            │  ← Use Cases, Workflows
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│              Domain Layer               │  ← Business Logic, Entities
├─────────────────────────────────────────┤
│           Infrastructure Layer          │  ← APIs, Storage, Crypto
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### 2. Separation of Concerns Strategy
- **Presentation Layer**: Pure UI components with no business logic
- **Business Logic Layer**: Platform-agnostic domain services
- **Data Layer**: Unified data access and synchronization
- **Integration Layer**: Cross-app communication and shared services

## 🔄 Business Logic Extraction Strategy

### Current State Analysis
**GeoTag™ Current Architecture Issues:**
- Business logic mixed with UI components
- Direct API calls in presentation layer
- Crypto operations scattered across components
- Location services tightly coupled with UI

### Target State: Clean Separation

#### 1. Domain Services Layer
```typescript
// packages/shared-core/domain/mining/
export class MiningOperationService {
  constructor(
    private gpsService: GPSService,
    private cryptoService: CryptoService,
    private storageService: StorageService
  ) {}

  async createGoldLotRegistration(data: GoldLotData): Promise<GoldLot> {
    // Pure business logic - no UI dependencies
    const location = await this.gpsService.getCurrentLocation();
    const cryptoProof = await this.cryptoService.generateProof(data);
    const goldLot = new GoldLot(data, location, cryptoProof);
    
    await this.storageService.save(goldLot);
    return goldLot;
  }
}
```

#### 2. Presentation Layer (Clean Components)
```typescript
// apps/geotag/src/screens/GoldLotRegistration.tsx
export const GoldLotRegistrationScreen = () => {
  const miningService = useMiningService(); // Dependency injection
  const [state, actions] = useGoldLotViewModel(); // UI state management
  
  const handleSubmit = async (data: GoldLotFormData) => {
    // Delegate to business logic
    const result = await miningService.createGoldLotRegistration(data);
    actions.setResult(result);
  };

  return (
    <GoldLotRegistrationForm 
      onSubmit={handleSubmit}
      loading={state.loading}
      result={state.result}
    />
  );
};
```

#### 3. Cross-App Integration Points
```typescript
// packages/shared-core/integration/
export class TradeDeskIntegrationService {
  async shareGoldLotWithTradeDesk(goldLotId: string): Promise<void> {
    // Deep integration logic
    const goldLot = await this.getGoldLot(goldLotId);
    const tradePassData = this.transformForTradeDesk(goldLot);
    
    // Cross-app communication
    await this.tradePassAPI.importGoldLot(tradePassData);
    await this.notificationService.notifyTradeDesk(goldLotId);
  }
}
```

## 🔧 Technical Implementation Details

### Dependency Injection Pattern
```typescript
// packages/shared-core/di/container.ts
export class ServiceContainer {
  private services = new Map();
  
  register<T>(key: string, factory: () => T): void {
    this.services.set(key, factory);
  }
  
  resolve<T>(key: string): T {
    const factory = this.services.get(key);
    return factory();
  }
}

// Usage in apps
const container = new ServiceContainer();
container.register('miningService', () => 
  new MiningOperationService(
    container.resolve('gpsService'),
    container.resolve('cryptoService'),
    container.resolve('storageService')
  )
);
```

### Shared State Management
```typescript
// packages/shared-core/state/
export class SharedStateManager {
  private stores = new Map();
  
  // Cross-app state synchronization
  async syncBetweenApps(stateKey: string, data: any): Promise<void> {
    await this.broadcastToApps(stateKey, data);
    await this.persistState(stateKey, data);
  }
}
```

### Integration Communication Layer
```typescript
// packages/shared-core/integration/messaging.ts
export class InterAppMessaging {
  async sendToTradeDesk(message: IntegrationMessage): Promise<void> {
    // Handle cross-app communication
    // Could use AsyncStorage, SQLite, or direct memory sharing
  }
  
  async receiveFromGeoTag(handler: MessageHandler): Promise<void> {
    // Listen for messages from other app
  }
}
```

---

## 🛡️ Quality Assurance Framework

### Code Quality Standards (10/10 Target)

#### 1. TypeScript Configuration
```json
// Strict TypeScript settings across all packages
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    "strict": true,
    "noImplicitAny": true,
    "exactOptionalPropertyTypes": true,
    "noImplicitReturns": true,
    "noFallthroughCasesInSwitch": true,
    "noImplicitOverride": true
  }
}
```

#### 2. ESLint + Prettier Configuration
```json
// .eslintrc.js - Enterprise-grade linting
{
  "extends": [
    "@react-native-community",
    "plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended",
    "plugin:react-hooks/recommended"
  ],
  "rules": {
    "complexity": ["error", 10],
    "max-depth": ["error", 4],
    "max-lines-per-function": ["error", 50]
  }
}
```

#### 3. Testing Strategy
- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage for business logic
- **Integration Tests**: Cross-layer interaction testing
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user workflows
- **Performance Tests**: Load and stress testing

#### 4. Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)
```markdown
# ADR-001: Monorepo Architecture
## Status: Accepted
## Context: Need to share code between GeoTag and TradeDesk
## Decision: Use Lerna-based monorepo with shared packages
## Consequences: Better code reuse, unified tooling, complex setup
```

---

## 🚀 Performance & Scalability Considerations

### Bundle Optimization Strategy
```typescript
// Metro configuration for optimized bundling
module.exports = {
  resolver: {
    alias: {
      '@shared/core': path.resolve(__dirname, 'packages/shared-core'),
      '@shared/ui': path.resolve(__dirname, 'packages/shared-ui'),
    },
  },
  transformer: {
    // Tree-shaking for shared packages
    unstable_allowRequireContext: true,
  },
};
```

### Memory Management
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical services
- Use React.memo and useMemo for expensive computations
- Proper cleanup of listeners and subscriptions
- Efficient image and asset management

### Data Synchronization
```typescript
// packages/shared-infrastructure/sync/
export class DataSyncService {
  async syncCriticalData(): Promise<void> {
    // Intelligent sync strategy
    // - Priority-based syncing
    // - Conflict resolution
    // - Offline queue management
  }
}
```

---

## 🔐 Security Architecture

### Cryptographic Services Isolation
```typescript
// packages/shared-crypto/
export class SecureCryptoService {
  private keyStore: SecureKeyStore;
  
  // All crypto operations isolated and auditable
  async signDocument(document: Document): Promise<Signature> {
    // Secure signing with hardware-backed keys where available
  }
}
```

### Cross-App Security
- Secure inter-app communication channels
- Shared authentication tokens with proper scoping
- Audit logging for all cross-app operations
- Secure storage for sensitive shared data

---

## 📊 Monitoring & Observability

### Application Metrics
- Performance monitoring across both apps
- Business logic execution metrics
- Cross-app integration success rates
- User experience metrics

### Error Tracking
```typescript
// packages/shared-infrastructure/monitoring/
export class SharedErrorTracker {
  async logCrossAppError(error: Error, context: AppContext): Promise<void> {
    // Unified error tracking across apps
    // Integration with Sentry, Bugsnag, etc.
  }
}
```
