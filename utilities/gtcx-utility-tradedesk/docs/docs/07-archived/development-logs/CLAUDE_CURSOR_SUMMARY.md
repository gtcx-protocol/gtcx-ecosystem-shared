## Claude/Cursor Exports – Executive Summaries

This document summarizes the large conversation exports in `claude/cursor`. It distills actionable insights and recommended actions for GeoTag™ and TradePass™.

### 1) 1cursor_review_the_claude_folder.md
- Focus: High-level review of the `claude` folder and a survey of key markdown and TypeScript artifacts.
- Themes:
  - Production-readiness claim for Ghana pilot (95%).
  - Architecture: Split apps (GeoTag™ location, TradePass™ identity) with deep integration.
  - Security: Government‑grade crypto and biometrics.
  - UX: Role-based onboarding and contextual workflows.
- Recommended actions:
  - Formalize rollout plan for role-based onboarding without disrupting current users.
  - Validate crypto primitives coverage against requirements and performance budget.

### 2) 2cursor_review_the_claude_folder.md
- Focus: Reiteration of the review with additional detail and prompts for implementation.
- Themes:
  - Detailed step-by-step prompts for building role-based onboarding and core workflows.
  - Emphasis on preserving existing GPS/crypto while layering contextual UX.
- Recommended actions:
  - Create feature flags and legacy mode to ensure zero-risk migration.
  - Establish acceptance criteria and UAT for the onboarding experience.

### 3) 3cursor_review_the_claude_folder.md (very large)
- Focus: Deep dive into four pillars:
  1) Role-based onboarding (miner, inspector, company, trader)
  2) New Gold Lot Registration workflow (GPS, photos, crypto proofs, certificate)
  3) Daily Work Site Verification (one-tap sessions, background location, summaries)
  4) Government Inspector Interface (checklists, evidence, signatures, reports)
- Also: Intelligent Contextual Suggestions (AI) and a safe integration plan.
- Recommended actions:
  - Implement the four workflows behind feature flags; add analytics to measure adoption.
  - Plan AI suggestions as a separate epic under “ai-analytics”.
  - Define UAT scenarios per persona and success metrics.

### 4) 4cursor_continue_the_discussion.md
- Focus: Health checks, QR page updates, and packaging scripts alignment.
- Themes:
  - Ensure `main` entry is `expo-router/entry`.
  - Keep QR launch surface current for test devices.
- Recommended actions:
  - Keep health check and QR regenerators part of release QA gates.

### 5) 5cursor_continue_the_discussion.md
- Focus: As above, emphasizing developer tooling ergonomics.
- Recommended actions:
  - Codify in pre-release checklist; tie to health-check outputs.

### 6) cursor_review_the_claude_folder.md (very large)
- Focus: Combines the above with extended rationale, Ghana‑specific considerations, and staged rollout.
- Themes:
  - Government approval path, adoption by personas, and staged rollout (legacy vs enhanced).
  - Performance, accessibility, and field‑use constraints.
- Recommended actions:
  - Define explicit rollout toggles, migration steps, and monitoring dashboards.

### 7) cursor_continue_the_discussion.md
- Focus: Dev loops around health checks, expo/QRs, and alignment fixes.
- Recommended actions:
  - Treat these as standard DX tasks for each environment and document in release playbooks.

### Cross‑cutting Insights
- Contextual UX is the main product lever; keep the technical core stable and wrap guided workflows on top.
- Persona-specific UIs should map to measurable outcomes (completion time, accuracy, compliance, adoption).
- AI suggestions should start simple (rule-based + telemetry) and evolve to ML once signal exists.
- Staged rollout and feature flags are essential to de‑risk changes.

### Immediate Next Actions (High-Impact)
1) Ship role-based onboarding with legacy toggle and analytics.
2) Implement Gold Lot Registration workflow (with cert generation) end‑to‑end.
3) Stand up Daily Work Site Verification with battery/perf budgets.
4) Define inspector interface MVP scope and UAT with checklists/evidence.
5) Add health-check probes for new screens and CI gate on passing status.
