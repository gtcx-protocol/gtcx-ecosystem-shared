- Document verification using mock implementations
- Cross-app communication protocols incomplete
- Audit trail and compliance reporting systems removed

#### **USER EXPERIENCE** 
- Inconsistent button styling across screens (credentials vs others)
- Missing enterprise visual cohesion 
- Incomplete user flow implementations
- No guided onboarding for government users

#### **ENTERPRISE FEATURES**
- Multi-modal biometric enrollment incomplete
- Government document OCR/verification disabled  
- Cryptographic proof generation not production-ready
- Cross-app integration with GeoTag™ non-functional
