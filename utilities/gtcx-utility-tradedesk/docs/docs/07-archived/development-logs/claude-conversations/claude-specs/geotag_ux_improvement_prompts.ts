2. Add new workflow screens that use existing GPS/crypto services
3. Create role-specific home screens that navigate to enhanced workflows
4. Preserve all existing API endpoints and data structures

TECHNICAL IMPLEMENTATION:
```typescript
// New app structure preserving existing code
<App>
  <RoleProvider>
    <RoleBasedNavigation>
      {/* New contextual interfaces */}
      <SmallScaleMinerHome />
      <GovernmentInspectorHome />
      
      {/* Enhanced existing screens */}
      <ImprovedGPSScreen /> // Your existing GPS with better UX
      <ImprovedCameraScreen /> // Your existing camera with workflows
      <ImprovedHistoryScreen /> // Your existing history with role filtering
    </RoleBasedNavigation>
  </RoleProvider>
</App>
```

MIGRATION STRATEGY:
