## üéØ **EPIC P0.3: PRODUCTION DEPLOYMENT INFRASTRUCTURE**
*Duration: 4-5 days | Business Value: CRITICAL | Risk: HIGH*

### **Epic Goal**
Build enterprise-grade, automated deployment pipeline supporting Ghana pilot launch and scaling to global operations.

#### **üìñ USER STORIES**

**US-P0-008: DevOps Team Deployment Automation**
```
As a DevOps engineer responsible for GTCX platform deployment,
I want fully automated CI/CD pipeline with comprehensive monitoring and rollback capabilities,
So that we can deploy updates safely and scale operations globally with zero downtime.

Acceptance Criteria:
- Automated testing, building, and deployment for all three applications
- Blue-green deployment with automatic rollback on failure detection
- Multi-environment support: development, staging, production
- Comprehensive monitoring and alerting for all system components
- Security scanning and compliance verification in deployment pipeline
- Database migration automation with rollback capabilities
- Infrastructure as Code with version control and change tracking
- Disaster recovery procedures with automated failover
```

#### **‚öôÔ∏è TECHNICAL STORIES**
